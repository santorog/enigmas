# The circular train 

## Problem

You are locked in a circular train with no windows. Each coach contains a light bulb which is randomly turned on or off. Your persecutor tells you that he will set you free if you are able to tell him how many coaches there are in this train.

How would you proceed ?

## Using code snippets

WIP

#### Scala

From the scala directory, if you have *scalac* and *make* you can directly use :

```bash
```

If you would rather use sbt :

```bash
```

#### Python

From the python directory

```bash
```
