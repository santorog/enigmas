# The 7-sided die

## Problem

You are given a 6-sided die. You are asked to create a 7-sided die.

In particular, all events (1 to 7) must have the same probability of occuring.

How would you do it ?

## Using code snippets

#### Scala

From the scala directory, if you have *scalac* and *make* you can directly use :

```bash
make
```

If you would rather use sbt :

```bash
sbt compile run
```

#### Python

From the python directory :

```bash
python3 die.py
```
